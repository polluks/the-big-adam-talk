*** Lo-Res Graphics

#+begin_src basic
10 GR
11 COLOR = INT(RND(1)*16)
12 PRINT "BOXES"
20 x1 = INT(RND(1)*39)
30 x2 = INT(RND(1)*39)
40 y1 = INT(RND(1)*39)
50 y2 = INT(RND(1)*39)
60 HLIN x1, x2 AT y1
70 HLIN x1, x2 AT y2
80 VLIN y1, y2 AT x1
90 VLIN y1, y2 AT x2
100 GOTO 11
#+end_src

*** Hi-Res Graphic

#+begin_src basic
100 HGR
101 PRINT "SINE WAVE HARMONIC PLOT"
110 HCOLOR = 1
120 a = 50
130 f = .0125
140 p = 0
150 FOR i = 0 TO 4
160 FOR x = 0 TO 255
170 y = a*SIN(2*3.14159*f*x+p)+100
180 HPLOT x, y
190 NEXT x
200 f = f*2: i = i+1
210 HCOLOR = i
220 NEXT i
#+end_src

*** Hi-Res color clash

- HGR uses VDP MODE 2 (BITMAP)
  
- Due to color attributes being 8x1 pixels,
  some color clash does occur.
  
#+begin_src basic
100 HGR
101 PRINT "MOIRE PATTERN"
102 C=1:S=3
110 HCOLOR=C
120 FOR x=0 to 255 STEP S:HPLOT 128,80 TO X,1:NEXT X
130 FOR y=0 to 159 STEP S:HPLOT 128,80 TO 255,Y:NEXT Y
140 FOR x=255 to 0 STEP -S:HPLOT 128,80 TO x,159:NEXT X
150 FOR y=159 to 0 STEP -S:HPLOT 128,80 TO 1,y:NEXT Y
160 C=C+1
170 GOTO 110
